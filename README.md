# PassivePy



Our aim with this work is to create a reliable (e.g., passive voice judgments are consistent), valid (e.g., passive voice judgments are accurate), flexible (e.g., texts can be assessed at different units of analysis), replicable (e.g., the approach can be performed by a range of research teams with varying levels of computational expertise), and scalable way (e.g., small and large collections of texts can be analyzed) to capture passive voice from different corpora for social and psychological evaluations of text. To achieve these aims, we introduce PassivePy, a fully transparent and documented Python library.

## Manual
### Step 1.
 Open your Python coding environment. We will use visual studio for this tutorial and suggest you install it too if you don’t already have a coding environment (link for installation). Make sure to install Python and Jupyter notebook by clicking on the Extensions icon (or ctrl + shift + x) and searching for python and Jupyter notebook.


### Step 2.
 In whatever coding environment you are, try creating a file. In Visual Studio, we right-click on the left side of the page and select “New File”. Type in the name and make sure to add “.ipynb” at the end.
